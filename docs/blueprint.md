- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) to provide a modern, tech-focused feel. This heavily desaturated version of blue allows the primary to take precedence.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Smooth and subtle animations for UI elements to enhance user experience.
- Glassmorphism cards for a modern and translucent interface.
- Lottie-based animated icons to add a dynamic element.
